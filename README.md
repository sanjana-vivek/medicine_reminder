# Automatic medicine reminder system
It’s designed around Arduino Uno technology, is a hardware and software combinational project. It’s aimed at seamlessly managing medication schedules. This smart system employs a real-time clock module to precisely track time, ensuring timely alerts for medication intake. The device features a buzzer for audible reminders and an LCD display for clear visual notifications. Set to trigger three times a day at strategic intervals—Morning (8 am), Afternoon (2 pm), and Night (8 pm)—this reminder system proves to be an invaluable asset in healthcare settings, especially in busy environments like hospitals. It simplifies the process of medication administration, particularly when attending to multiple patients in various rooms becomes challenging.The device is not only a time-saving solution but also significantly reduces the likelihood of human error in medication management. Its user-friendly interface makes it accessible for both healthcare professionals and patients. By automating the reminder process, it ensures that critical medications are administered promptly, enhancing overall patient care.The coding has been done using Arduino C.
